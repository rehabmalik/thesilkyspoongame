# The Silky Spoon – Restaurant Simulation Game 

A simple text-based Java game where you play as a waiter at *The Silky Spoon*.  
Take orders, serve food, answer customer questions, and earn tips.

## 🎮 How to Play
- `Welcome` guests when they arrive  
- `Greet` your table once everyone is seated and take their order  
- `Enter` their order so it gets sent to the kitchen  
- `Serve` their food promptly  
- If customers ask questions, choose the correct answer from the provided options  
- You can type `help` anytime to see your options  
- Remember: The dining area and kitchen are separate so plan your movements accordingly!

## 🏆 Game Rules & Win Conditions
- You start with 3 “strikes” (a.k.a. *fuck-ups*). If you lose them all, you’re fired and lose the game.  
- Finish the shift without using all your strikes to earn tips and win.  
- You can ask the kitchen for help with questions, but you’ll lose the chance to answer for tips.
